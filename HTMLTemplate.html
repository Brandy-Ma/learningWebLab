    <tagname abc = "xyz" 
            attribute = value
    <a> this is a link tab
    <a href   =  "link here"  attribute =value
       cobntent goes here 
    </a>

    <img> image tab
    <img src = "pusheen.png" \>  AKA <img src = "image.png" /> also works as lonng
    as the image is in the folder
    these are self closing tags meaning they dont have anything afterwards

    if the image isnt part of the folder you need to tell it where to find it 
    ex
    <img src = "images/pusheen.gif"/>

    CSS
    
    Example of css rule:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors

    Classes are all identified by a . in CSS
    While using ID's it is identified by #

    Differences between classes and id's
    ID: An element can only have one ID

    Classes: Can be applied to multiple elements + they can have multiple classes

    ID: must be unique in any given HTML document

    ClasS: Can use the same class on multiple elements

    Recommendation: Uses classes more than ID's since they can be more flexible
